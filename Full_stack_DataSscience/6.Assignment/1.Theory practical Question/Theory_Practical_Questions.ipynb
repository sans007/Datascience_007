        "        Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a powerful classification and regression tool that aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes. For linearly separable data, SVM finds this hyperplane directly, while for non-linear data, it uses kernel functions to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space. SVM is robust and effective, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, but can be computationally demanding and requires careful parameter tuning.\n",
