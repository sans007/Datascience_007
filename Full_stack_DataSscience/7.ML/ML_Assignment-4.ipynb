    "    Feature Caching:\n",

    "    Concept: Feature caching is a technique used to store intermediate results or transformations of features during dimensionality reduction processes. This helps to speed up computations by avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use in Dimensionality Reduction: In dimensionality reduction, feature caching can optimize the performance by precomputing and storing results of feature transformations or projections. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or complex algorithms, allowing for faster iterative processing and analysis.\n",
